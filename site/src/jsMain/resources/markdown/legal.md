By downloading, installing, or using the Goodtime mobile application ("the App"), you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service. If you do not agree to these terms, please do not use the App.

#### 2. Description of Service

Goodtime is a productivity timer application that helps you manage your time and track work sessions. The App is available for Android and iOS devices and is distributed through Google Play, the App Store, and F-Droid. The App is open source software licensed under the GPL-3.0 license. The source code is available at [https://github.com/adrcotfas/goodtime](https://github.com/adrcotfas/goodtime).

#### 3. In-App Purchases

The App offers optional in-app purchases (one-time purchases) that unlock additional features. All purchases are processed through Google Play Billing (Android), App Store (iOS), and RevenueCat (payment processing service). By making a purchase, you agree to the respective platform's terms of service.

Refund requests are handled according to Google Play and App Store policies. While we generally defer to platform policies, we may consider refund exceptions on a case-by-case basis if you're not satisfied with your purchase. Please contact us at [contact@goodtime.tools](mailto:contact@goodtime.tools) to discuss.

#### 4. Cloud Sync

The App offers optional cloud synchronization through Google Drive (Android) and iCloud (iOS). This feature is entirely optional and requires your explicit authorization.

You are responsible for managing your Google Drive or iCloud storage, ensuring you have sufficient storage space, backing up important data, and the security of your Google or Apple account.

While we strive to provide reliable sync functionality, we do not guarantee continuous availability of sync features, prevention of data loss or corruption, compatibility with all device configurations, or resolution of conflicts between synced data. We strongly recommend maintaining local backups of important data.

#### 5. Privacy

Your use of the App is also governed by our Privacy Policy (below). Please review it to understand how we handle your data.

#### 6. Disclaimers

THE APP IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT.

We make no guarantees regarding productivity improvements, time management success, or any specific outcomes from using the App. We do not warrant that the App will be uninterrupted, secure, or error-free, that defects will be corrected, or that results from using the App will meet your requirements.

#### 7. Limitation of Liability

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS OR REVENUES, WHETHER INCURRED DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, OR ANY LOSS OF DATA, USE, GOODWILL, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES RESULTING FROM YOUR USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE APP.

#### 8. Third-Party Services

The App integrates with third-party services including Google Play Services, Google Drive API, Apple iCloud, and RevenueCat. Your use of these services is subject to their respective terms of service and privacy policies. We are not responsible for the practices or content of these third-party services.

#### 9. Changes to Terms

We may update these Terms of Service from time to time. Changes will be posted on this page with an updated "Last Updated" date. Significant changes will be communicated through the App or app store release notes. Your continued use of the App after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated terms.

#### 10. Governing Law

These Terms of Service shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the European Union, without regard to conflict of law provisions.

#### Optional Cloud Sync

Goodtime offers optional cloud sync functionality that allows you to back up and synchronize your data across devices:

- **Data deletion:** You can delete synced data at any time by removing the app folder from your Google Drive or through your iCloud settings

**Important:** Cloud sync is entirely optional. If you choose not to enable it, all your data remains stored locally on your device only.

#### Device Backup

If you have activated system backup in your device settings (Android Backup or iCloud Backup), a copy of your app data may be included in your device backups:
