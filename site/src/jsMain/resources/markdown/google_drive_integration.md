# About Goodtime

## What is Goodtime?

Goodtime is an open-source productivity timer application for Android and iOS that helps users manage their time effectively using the Pomodoro Technique and custom timer profiles. The app enables users to:

- Track focused work sessions with customizable timers
- Organize tasks using labels and time profiles
- Monitor productivity through detailed statistics of completed sessions
- Maintain focus without distractions (no ads, no analytics, no tracking)

## Why Goodtime Requests Google Drive Access

Goodtime offers an **optional** cloud synchronization feature that allows users to back up and sync their productivity data across multiple devices. When you grant Google Drive access, Goodtime can:

- **Back up your data**: Store your timer labels, time profiles, and session statistics in your personal Google Drive
- **Sync across devices**: Keep your productivity data synchronized between your phone and tablet
- **Restore your data**: Recover your settings and history when setting up a new device

### What Data Does Goodtime Store in Google Drive?

When you enable cloud sync, Goodtime stores the following data in a dedicated folder within your Google Drive:

- **Labels**: Custom categories you create to organize your work sessions
- **Time profiles**: Your customized timer settings (work duration, break duration, etc.)
- **Session statistics**: History of your completed focus sessions

### Important Privacy Information

- **Your data stays in YOUR Google Drive**: We do not have access to your Google Drive or the data stored there
- **You control your data**: You can delete synced data at any time by removing the Goodtime folder from your Google Drive
- **Cloud sync is optional**: You can use Goodtime without enabling Google Drive sync. All data remains stored locally on your device
- **No email or personal information collected**: While we request Google Drive access, we do NOT collect, retrieve, or store your email address or any other personally identifiable information
- **No third-party data sharing**: Your productivity data is never shared with third parties
